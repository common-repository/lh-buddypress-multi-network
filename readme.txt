Segregate your multsite into multiple buddypress social networks.

== Description ==

Requires BuddyPress 5.0 or greater.

This plugin segregates BuddyPress social networks in a multi network WordPress install so that each WP network has a different social network. 

All functionality, eg groups, friends, profile fields, activity etc are now independent for each site

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you write this plugin?  =

Because the other two plugins that purport to do this, are not maintained and donÂ´t work properly.

= Can you give me some examples of sites running this plugin?  =

The [LocalHero project website](https://lhero.org) and the [Melbourne Touch rugby association](https://princesparktouch.com) I founded both run on the same multisite that is powered by this plugin.

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Buddypress Multi Network, and all [LocalHero](https://lhero.org) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-multi-network/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-multi-network/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.

= What if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?  =
